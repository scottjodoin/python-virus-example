#Python-Virus-Example

This is a class assignment from MIT 6.00.2x

Uses classes to simulate what happens when a virus mutate slowly and a treatment is introduced halfway through.


Unfortunately, the results appear grim when the mutated virus explodes in population after the drug is treated.. An assignment for MIT 6.00.2x

Note that it might take repl.it around 6 seconds to process the simulation.

Final result should look like this:

ResistantVirus is the total count of viruses that are resistant to the drug 'guttagonol'
